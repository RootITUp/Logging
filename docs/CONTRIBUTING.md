# How to contribute

Contributions are welcome!

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/EsOsO/Logging/pull/new/dev) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, I will love you forever if you include Pester tests. Please follow my coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. I tried to optimize for readability:

* I indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
* Adhere to [style guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle)
* Update [README](README.md) documentation as well to reflect contribution
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks, Massimo Bonvicini
